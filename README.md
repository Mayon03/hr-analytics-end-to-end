# HR Analytics – End-to-End Data Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is based on a business request to identify **which departments and projects are at risk of being over budget or underperforming**. Department budgets are set at **2-year intervals**, but management wanted visibility into whether a single year’s allocation could cover all expenses.  

The solution integrates **multiple datasets** (employee information, salary data, department budgets, and project details), organizes them in a **SQL database**, and develops an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Identify **departments and projects “in the red”** (over budget or underperforming).  
2. Organize raw data (CSV/Excel) into a **structured SQL database**.  
3. Build a **Power BI dashboard** for executives to monitor:  
   - Employee performance  
   - Salary distribution  
   - Departmental budgets  
   - Project health
